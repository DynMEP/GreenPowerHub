# 🌱 GreenPowerHub

Welcome to **GreenPowerHub**, created by Alfonso Antonio Dávila Vera! With over 25 years of experience in electrical engineering, specializing in power systems and distribution, I am dedicated to advancing sustainable energy solutions. This repository is a hub for tools, simulations, and resources that promote the integration of renewable energy sources, enhance the efficiency, reliability, and safety of electrical power systems, and support the widespread adoption of green technologies. Built on my expertise in high-voltage equipment, blueprints, schematics, and tools like MATLAB, ETAP, DIALux, AutoCAD, Revit, and Dynamo, the resources here are designed to drive innovation in MEP and energy infrastructure. Hosted under the MIT License, explore below to contribute to a greener future. New content is added regularly—check back often!

## 🌞 Mission
Aligned with my proposed endeavor for the EB-2 NIW visa, GreenPowerHub aims to:
- Develop tools for renewable energy integration (solar PV, wind, hybrid systems).
- Enhance power system efficiency and reliability through data-driven simulations.
- Foster collaboration with stakeholders (government, research, industry) to shape sustainable energy infrastructure.
- Contribute to U.S. economic growth, technology transfer, and environmental benefits.

## 🔧 Tools & Resources
Below is a growing collection of scripts, models, and documentation supporting sustainable energy solutions.

### 1. Hybrid Renewable Energy Integration Simulator 🌬️☀️
- **File**: `Hybrid_Renewable_Integration.m`
- **Description**: A MATLAB script simulating a hybrid solar PV and wind energy system integrated into a power distribution grid. It calculates power outputs based on irradiance, temperature, and wind speed, applies a basic MPPT approximation, and estimates daily energy yield and grid contribution. Saves results to CSV for MEP integration.
- **Benefits**: Saves 5–10 hours per analysis, supports NEC-compliant designs, and aids renewable project planning.
- **Location**: `github.com/GreenPowerHub/GreenPowerHub/tree/main/matlab`
- **Usage**: Run in MATLAB with customizable parameters (e.g., PV size, wind turbine specs).

### 2. [Future Addition] Renewable Load Optimizer 📊
- **Planned File**: `Renewable_Load_Optimizer.py`
- **Description**: A Python script to optimize load distribution for renewable energy systems, integrating with Dynamo for Revit MEP workflows. Planned to include demand factor calculations per NEC 220.
- **Benefits**: Enhances grid reliability, reduces over-design, and supports microgrid designs.
- **Status**: Under development; contributions welcome!

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
- **MATLAB**: Base version (no toolboxes required for initial script).
- **Python** (for future scripts): Version 3.x, with libraries like NumPy, Pandas.
- **Revit/Dynamo** (optional): For MEP integration with future Python scripts.

### Setup
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/GreenPowerHub/GreenPowerHub.git`
2. Navigate to the desired folder (e.g., `/matlab` for MATLAB scripts).
3. Run scripts in their respective environments (MATLAB for `.m`, Python for `.py`).
4. Customize input data (e.g., irradiance, wind speed) based on project needs.

## 🚀 Usage
- **Hybrid_Renewable_Integration.m**: Open in MATLAB, adjust parameters (e.g., `PV_rated_power`, `wind_speed`), and run. Check `hybrid_energy_output.csv` for results.
- **Future Scripts**: Follow inline comments or wiki guides (to be added).

## 🎯 Benefits
- **Time Savings**: Reduce analysis time by 5–10 hours per project.
- **Sustainability Impact**: Support renewable adoption, reduce carbon footprint, and enhance U.S. energy resilience.
- **Economic Value**: Contribute to infrastructure development, R&D, and technology transfer as outlined in my professional plan.
- **NEC Compliance**: Ensure designs meet 2023 standards for safe integration.

## 🌍 Contributing to the U.S.
This repository reflects my commitment to:
- **Economic Growth**: Streamlining renewable projects boosts job creation in the $1.5T U.S. construction sector.
- **Technology Transfer**: Open-source tools enable widespread adoption by MEP firms and researchers.
- **Environmental Benefits**: Simulations optimize resource use, reducing waste and emissions.
