# 🌱 GreenPowerHub

Welcome to **GreenPowerHub**, created by Alfonso Antonio Dávila Vera! With over 25 years of experience in electrical engineering, specializing in power systems, distribution, and sustainable energy solutions. I am passionate about advancing a greener future. This repository, serves as a hub for tools, simulations, and resources that promote the integration of renewable energy sources like solar PV and wind, while enhancing the efficiency, reliability, and safety of electrical power systems. Built on my expertise with MATLAB, ETAP, DIALux, AutoCAD, Revit, and Dynamo, the content here is hosted under the MIT License. Explore below to contribute to a sustainable tomorrow, new resources are added regularly!

## 🌞 Mission
GreenPowerHub reflects:
- Develop innovative tools for renewable energy integration.
- Enhance power system efficiency and reliability through data-driven simulations.
- Foster global collaboration with diverse stakeholders to advance sustainable practices.
- Drive positive impact through cutting-edge energy solutions.

## 🔧 Tools & Resources
Below is a growing collection of scripts and models supporting sustainable energy solutions.

### 1. Hybrid Renewable Energy Integration Simulator 🌬️☀️
- **File**: `Hybrid_Renewable_Integration.m`
- **Description**: A MATLAB script simulating a hybrid solar PV and wind energy system integrated into a power distribution grid. Launched today, October 07, 2025, it calculates power outputs based on irradiance, temperature, and wind speed, applies a basic MPPT approximation, and estimates daily energy yield and grid contribution. Saves results to CSV for MEP integration.
- **Benefits**: Saves 5–10 hours per analysis, supports NEC 2023-compliant designs, and aids renewable project planning.
- **Location**: `github.com/DynMEP/GreenPowerHub/tree/main`
- **Usage**: Run in MATLAB with customizable parameters (e.g., `PV_rated_power`, `wind_speed`).

### 2. [Future Addition] Renewable Load Optimizer 📊
- **Planned File**: `Renewable_Load_Optimizer.py`
- **Description**: A Python script to optimize load distribution for renewable energy systems, integrating with Dynamo for Revit MEP workflows. Planned to include demand factor calculations per NEC 220.
- **Benefits**: Enhances grid reliability, reduces over-design, and supports diverse energy projects.
- **Status**: Under development; contributions welcome!

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
- **MATLAB**: Base version (no toolboxes required for initial script).
- **Python** (for future scripts): Version 3.x, with libraries like NumPy, Pandas.
- **Revit/Dynamo** (optional): For MEP integration with future Python scripts.

### Setup
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/DynMEP/GreenPowerHub.git`
2. Navigate to the desired folder (e.g., `/matlab` for MATLAB scripts).
3. Run scripts in their respective environments (MATLAB for `.m`, Python for `.py`).
4. Customize input data (e.g., irradiance, wind speed) based on project needs.

## 🚀 Usage
- **Hybrid_Renewable_Integration.m**: Open in MATLAB, adjust parameters, and run. Check `hybrid_energy_output.csv` for results.
- **Future Scripts**: Follow inline comments or wiki guides (to be added).

## 🎯 Benefits
- **Time Savings**: Reduce analysis time by 5–10 hours per project.
- **Sustainability Impact**: Support renewable adoption and reduce environmental footprint.
- **Efficiency Gains**: Enhance power system performance with reliable tools.
- **NEC Compliance**: Ensure designs meet 2023 standards for safe integration.

## 🌍 Contributing
- **Innovation**: Streamlines renewable projects with advanced tools.
- **Collaboration**: Open-source resources encourage global adoption and improvement.
- **Sustainability**: Optimizes resource use, reducing waste and emissions.
